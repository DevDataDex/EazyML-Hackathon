# EazyML-Hackathon
# Submitted by Devin Warner and Braden Carlson
# Hey EasyML Team! This was our first ever Hackathon, and although we didn't hardly understand anything we enjoyed the chance to explore this new machine learning interface. 
# Due to a family emergency I, Devin, wasn't able to spend as much time on the Hackathon as I would have liked, but I committed to myself that I would submit something, so this is what I've got. 
# I, Devin, liked how simple it was to use the EazyML interface, although I was frustrated that I was not able to back track and correct what I wanted to feed into my model. I especially felt this looking at Contribution to Model Weight (predicing Acres Burned), realizing that fatalities became the leading contributor. I know fatalities isn't a parameter we can use to predict wildfires, and so I wanted to fix my model, but I couldn't back up two steps, and had to start from the top again.
# We both got very confused when looking over the different model types (see file Question of RSquared). To our understanding RSquared is a positve measurement between 0 and 1, and we were puzzled to see our most succesful model had an RSquare measure of -0.00. Not to mention that the other models had RSquare values between -0.00 and -5.00.
