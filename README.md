# EazyML-Hackathon
# Hey EasyML Team! This was my first ever Hackathon, and although I didn't hardly understand anything I was glad to have the chance to explore a machine learning interface. 
# Due to a family emergency I wasn't able to spend as much time on the Hackathon as I would have liked, but I committed to myself that I would submit something, so this is what I've got.
