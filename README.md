# EazyML-Hackathon
# Submitted by Devin Warner and Braden Carlson
Hey EazyML Team! This was our first ever Hackathon, and although we didn't hardly understand anything we enjoyed the chance to explore this new machine learning interface. 

We weren't able to spend as much time on the Hackathon as we would have liked to, but we committed to ourselves that we would submit something, so this is what we've got. 

We liked how simple it was to use the EazyML interface, although we were frustrated that we was not able to back track and correct what we wanted to feed into our model. I especially felt this looking at Contribution to Model Weight (predicing Acres Burned), realizing that fatalities became the leading contributor. I know fatalities isn't a parameter we can use to predict wildfires, and so I wanted to fix my model, but I couldn't back up two steps, and had to start from the top again.

We both got very confused when looking over the different model types (see file Question of RSquared). To our understanding RSquared is a positve measurement between 0 and 1, and we were puzzled to see our most succesful model had an RSquare measure of -0.00. Not to mention that the other models had RSquare values between -0.00 and -5.00. 

Something we would like to see in EazyML is the ability to see the data visualization at the end along with the predictions. The charts and graphs (both two and three dimensional) that the program generates are spectacular for analysing and obtaining results, but can only be accessed for a brief second, then is lost once one has gone on to the prediction aspect of the program.

As far as our predictions go we only used the given California-Fire-Incidents file to both teach the model, and run the predictions, so we pretty much got what we were expecting. We both had a good time though working through the EazyML platform, and we felt more comfortable with it each time we used it.

An interesting observation we did make can be found in th "Trimmed Total Acreage Burned by County Over Time" file. We observed that each county only had one major wildfire during the 6 year period. This makes sense intuitively as once brush is burned it takes quite a few years for it to grow back. It would be interesting to see a longer time range of data to see on average how many years laspe between large fires in a particular county. We could use that information to help us with predictive models.
